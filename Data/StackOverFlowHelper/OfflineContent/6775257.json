This\n  provider determines location using satellites. Depending on\n  conditions, this provider may take a while to return a location fix.\n  Requires the permission android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>network \u2013> (AGPS, CellID, WiFi MACID):<\/strong> Name of the network\n  location provider. This provider determines location based on\n  availability of cell tower and WiFi access points. Results are\n  retrieved by means of a network lookup. Requires either of the\n  permissions android.permission.ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION or\n  android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION.<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>passive \u2013> (CellID, WiFi MACID):<\/strong> A special location provider for\n  receiving locations without actually initiating a location fix. This\n  provider can be used to passively receive location updates when other\n  applications or services request them without actually requesting the\n  locations yourself. This provider will return locations generated by\n  other providers. Requires the permission\n  android.permission.ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION, although if the GPS is not\n  enabled this provider might only return coarse fixes. This is what\n  Android calls these location providers, however, the underlying\n  technologies to make this stuff work is mapped to the specific set of\n  hardware and telco provided capabilities (network service).<\/p>\n  \n  <p><strong>The best way is to use the \u201cnetwork\u201d or \u201cpassive\u201d provider first,\n  and then fallback on \u201cgps\u201d, and depending on the task, switch between\n  providers. This covers all cases, and provides a lowest common\n  denominator service (in the worst case) and great service (in the best\n  case).<\/strong><\/p>\n<\/blockquote>\n\n<p><img src=\"https://i.stack.imgur.com/BFtnE.png\" alt=\"enter image description here\"><\/p>\n\n<p>Article Reference : <a href=\"https://developerlife.com/2010/10/20/gps/\" rel=\"noreferrer\">Android Location Providers - gps, network, passive By Nazmul Idris<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p>Code Reference : <a href=\"https://stackoverflow.com/a/3145655/28557\">https://stackoverflow.com/a/3145655/28557<\/a><\/p>\n\n<p><strong>-----------------------Update-----------------------<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>Now Android have <strong>Fused location provider<\/strong><\/p>\n\n<p>The Fused Location Provider intelligently manages the underlying location technology and gives you the best location according to your needs.
